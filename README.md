# AdventureWorks SQL Project

This project is a collection of SQL queries I wrote for practice using the **AdventureWorks2019** sample database (SQL Server).  
It includes both **analysis queries** (to get business insights) and **data quality checks** (to show how to handle data issues).

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Queries
These queries answer common business questions:

1. **Top Customers**  
   Find the top 10 customers based on total spending.

2. **Monthly Sales**  
   Show sales totals for each month in a given year.

3. **Top Products**  
   List the most sold products by quantity.  

4. **Average Order per City**  
   Calculate the average order value grouped by customer city.  

5. **Loyal Customers**  
   Identify customers with more than one order.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Queries
These queries check for possible data quality issues:

1. **Null Handling & Outliers**  
   Replace NULL values with defaults, mark very large or invalid order amounts.  

2. **Duplicates & Inconsistent Dates**  
   Detect duplicate customer records and check if shipping dates are earlier than order dates.
